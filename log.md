# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Jan 2 2018, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Solved a simple challenge on hackerEarth. The problem includes taking a list of numbers and finding the count of 1's in the binary conversion of each number in the list and then printing the list after sorting it by the count of 1's in ascending order.

2. Using splinter python wen application test framework, i can goto my twitter profile.

**Thoughts**: Used data structures including list, dict and tuple. And started learning a new python framework.

### Day 2: Jan 3 2018, wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Using splinter, wrote a script to find the current price of bitcoin and the INR equiavalent of USD. And tweet the latest price of bitcoin in USD and INR.
**Thoughts**: Getting the hang of splinter. Still need to solve a few bugs. Hopefully create a twitter bot which does the same thing, soon enough.
